# OpAmps

The file "Op-amp Graph Generator.xlsx" in this directory is an Excel spreadsheet that models various configurations of op-amps, including:
-Comparator
-Buffer
-Attenuator
-Unity-Gain Low-pass Filter (LPF)
-Unity-Gain High-pass Filter (HPF)
-Inverting Amplifier/Invertor
-Inverting Aplifier + LPF
-Inverting Aplifier + HPF
-Inverting Amplifier + Bias Voltage
-Inverting Amplifier + Bias + LPF
-Non-Inverting Amplifier
-Non-Inverting Amplifier + LPF
-Non-Inverting Amplifier + LPF (Unity Gain)
-Non-Inverting Amplifier + HPF (two variants)
-Non-Inverting Amplifier + Bias
-Differential Amplifier
-Summing Inverting Amplifier (2 and 3 inputs)
-Summing Non-Inverting Amplifier
-Transimpedance Amplifier
-Transimpedance Amplifier + Bias

It's the spreadsheet I wish I had when I started to learn about op-amps.
